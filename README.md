# FMBQ Timer

A simple timer app tailored specifically for use in Free Methodist Bible Quizzing.

Implemented as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)][PWA].

Need to keep track of timings for Free Methodist Bible Quizzing? This app has you covered with built-in timings that conform to the official rules.

## Features

- Simple and accessible interface allows you to start a timer quickly and without looking if you need to multitask (as a quizmaster may have to do).
- No more fumbling around with reset buttons! Starting a new timer will always immediately reset the timer to the full time. Very helpful when dealing with fast quizzers who don't wait for their full time to expire.
- Several built-in timer sounds that are non-distracting and clear.
- Built-in times for answering and prejumps (20 seconds), time-outs (60 seconds), and appeals (30 seconds).
